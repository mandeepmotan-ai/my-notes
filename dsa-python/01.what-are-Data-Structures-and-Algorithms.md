# what are Data Structures and Algorithms

**Data Structures** : organized way to make store/manage data 

**Algorithms** : logical way to solve given task/problems

*Data Structure* + *Algorithm* = *Working Program* 

**Data Structure** is kind of “*storage*”  and **Algorithm** is kind of “*logic*” 

# Data Structures

## Types of data structures:

### 1. Primitive

- basic data types
- hold single values
- predefined in programming language
- simply primitive is *fixed* data structure stored in “*stack*” memory (fast)
- primitive type primarily used for calculation purposes
- eg, int, float, char, boolean, etc

### 2. Non-Primitive

- complex
- derived from primitive types
- can store multiple values
- non-primitive is *dynamic* data structure stored in “*heap*” memory (flexible)
- non-primitive used for organization/storage

## Non-primitive divided in two categories:

Non-primitive structures are further divided on the basis of how the data is arranged in computer’s memory and how we walk through it.

### 1. Linear Data Structures

- data elements arranged in sequence or a linear list
- elements are connected like in a “line” one connected to another, then to other till end
- easy to implement; traversal in single run; often uses more memory if size is fixed
- further classified on basis of size:
    - static : fixed size
    - dynamic : size changes during runtime

### 2. Non-Linear Data Structure

- here elements not single line, instead connected to multiple elements like tree, node
- elements hierarchical or interconnected
- better for complex relationships; traversal requires more complex logic

# Algorithms

- logical recipes used to solve problems
- algorithm type is the specific strategy or pattern we use to process them
- categorized algorithms helps us recognize patterns in new problems

## Types of Algorithms:

### 1. Fundamental Task Algorithms

- **Sorting :** arranging data in specific order (ascending or descending)
    - eg, bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort
    - goal is to make data searchable or readable
- **Searching** : finding specific elements in data structure
    - eg, linear search, binary search
    - usage for like finding user in database, finding word in dictionary

### 2. Design Paradigms (strategies)

- **Recursive** : function calls itself with smaller input
    - key is to must have a “*base case*” to stop infinite loop
- **Divide and Conquer** : break big problems into smaller pieces → solve pieces → combine results
    - eg, merge sort, binary search
- **Dynamic Programming** : solves complex problems by breaking into overlapping sub-problems
    - key is to store results of sub-problems to avoid re-calculating (memoization)

### 3. Domain-Specific

- **Graph Algorithms** : solve problems related to network/nodes
    - usage such as GPS navigation showing nearest path, social media friends suggestion
