# NumPy Operations and Functions

NumPy provides two main ways to perform calculations: **Scalar Operations** (applying a single value to an array) and **Vector Operations** (applying operations between two arrays).

### 1. Array Operations

These operations are performed **element-wise**, meaning the operation is applied to every individual element in the array.

- **Scalar Operations:** Performing math between an array and a single number.
    - **Arithmetic:** `+`, , , `/`, `*` (power).
    - **Relational:** `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=` (returns a boolean array).
- **Vector Operations:** Performing math between two arrays of the same shape.

```python
a1 = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
a2 = np.arange(12,24).reshape(3,4)

# Scalar Arithmetic
a1 ** 2  # Squares every element

# Relational 
a2 == 15 # Returns True/False for each element

# Vector Arithmetic (Element-wise)
a1 ** a2 # Each element in a1 raised to the power of the corresponding element in a2
```

### 2. Array Functions (Aggregations)

NumPy includes built-in functions to summarize data. A key concept here is the **axis**:

- **`axis=0`**: Operations performed **column-wise**.
- **`axis=1`**: Operations performed **row-wise**.

| **Category** | **Functions** |
| --- | --- |
| **Statistics** | `np.max()`, `np.min()`, `np.sum()`, `np.prod()` |
| **Distribution** | `np.mean()`, `np.median()`, `np.std()` (Standard Deviation), `np.var()` (Variance) |
| **Math** | `np.sin()`, `np.cos()`, `np.log()`, `np.exp()` |
| **Rounding** | `np.round()`, `np.floor()`, `np.ceil()` |

```python
a1 = np.round(np.random.random((3,3)) * 100)

# Product of each column
np.prod(a1, axis=0)

# Variance of each row
np.var(a1, axis=1)

# Ceil (round up to nearest integer)
np.ceil(np.random.random((2,3)) * 100)
```

### 3. Dot Product

Unlike element-wise multiplication (`*`), the **Dot Product** follows matrix multiplication rules.

- **Rule:** The number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix.
- **Shape:** If you dot a `(3,4)` with a `(4,3)`, the result is a `(3,3)` matrix.

```python
a2 = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
a3 = np.arange(12,24).reshape(4,3)

# Matrix Multiplication
np.dot(a2, a3)
```
