# Indexing, Slicing, and Manipulation

## 1. Indexing & Slicing

Accessing elements in NumPy follows the `[row, column]` format for 2D and `[depth, row, column]` for 3D. Slicing uses the `start:stop:step` syntax.

```python
#basic created arrays for examples 
a1 = np.arange(10)
a2 = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
a3 = np.arange(8).reshape(2,2,2)
```

### → Basic Indexing

- **2D:** `a2[1,0]` accesses the element at row index 1, column index 0.
- **3D:** `a3[1,0,1]` accesses the 2nd matrix, 1st row, 2nd column.

### → Slicing Examples

- **1D:** `a1[2:5:2]` → Elements from index 2 to 4, skipping every other element.
- **2D Slicing:**  `a2[0:2, 1::2]` → First two rows, and every second column starting from index 1.
    - `a2[1:, 1:3]` → All rows from index 1 onwards, and columns 1 to 2.
- **3D Slicing:**
    - `a3[::2, 0, ::2]` → 1st and 3rd layer, 1st row of those layers, 1st and 3rd column.

### 2. Iterating

Iterating over arrays depends on the dimensions:

- **Standard `for` loop:** Iterates over the first axis (rows in 2D, matrices in 3D).
- **`np.nditer()`:** A specialized iterator that visits **every single element** in the array, regardless of its dimensions, in a single loop.

```python
# Iterating through every element in a 3D array
for i in np.nditer(a3):
    print(i)
```

### 3. Reshaping & Transformation

These operations change the structure of the data without modifying the underlying values.

- **`reshape`:** Changes the shape (e.g., 1D to 2D). Total elements must match.
- **`transpose` (or `.T`):** Swaps axes. In 2D, it flips rows with columns.
- **`ravel`:** Flattens any multi-dimensional array into a **1D array**.

```python
# Transpose (Rows becomes Columns)
np.transpose(a2) 
a2.T

# Flattening (3D/2D to 1D)
a3.ravel()
```

### Summary Table

| **Operation** | **Syntax** | **Result** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Indexing** | `arr[i, j]` | Returns a single element. |
| **Slicing** | `arr[start:stop:step]` | Returns a sub-section of the array. |
| **Flattening** | `arr.ravel()` | Converts to 1D. |
| **Transposing** | `arr.T` | Swaps rows and columns. |
| **Iterating** | `np.nditer(arr)` | Visits every element one by one. |
