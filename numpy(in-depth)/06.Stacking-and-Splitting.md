# Stacking and Splitting

These operations allow us to combine multiple arrays into one or break a single array into multiple sub-arrays.

### 1. Stacking (Combining Arrays)

Stacking joins a sequence of arrays along a new or existing axis. The arrays must have the same shape along the axes you are **not** stacking.

- **`np.hstack()` (Horizontal Stacking):** Appends arrays **side-by-side** (increases columns).
- **`np.vstack()` (Vertical Stacking):** Appends arrays **top-to-bottom** (increases rows).

```python
a4 = np.arange(12).reshape(3,4)
a5 = np.arange(12,24).reshape(3,4)

# Horizontal: Results in (3, 8) shape
np.hstack((a4, a5))

# Vertical: Results in (6, 4) shape
np.vstack((a4, a5))
```

### 2. Splitting (Breaking Arrays)

Splitting is the reverse of stacking. It divides one array into multiple smaller arrays.

- **`np.hsplit(array, parts)`:** Splits an array **horizontally** (column-wise). The number of parts must divide the total number of columns evenly.
- **`np.vsplit(array, parts)`:** Splits an array **vertically** (row-wise). The number of parts must divide the total number of rows evenly.

```python
# Horizontal Split: Breaks (3,4) into four (3,1) arrays
np.hsplit(a4, 4)

# Vertical Split: Breaks (3,4) into one (3,4) array
np.vsplit(a5, 1)
```

### Summary Table for Notion

| **Function** | **Action** | **Direction** | **Effect on Shape** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`hstack`** | Stacking | Horizontal | More Columns |
| **`vstack`** | Stacking | Vertical | More Rows |
| **`hsplit`** | Splitting | Horizontal | Cuts Columns |
| **`vsplit`** | Splitting | Vertical | Cuts Rows |
