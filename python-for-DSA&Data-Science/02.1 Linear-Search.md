# Linear Search

- it’s like we are looking for our friend’s name in a class attendance list
- we start at the top, check each name one by one, until we find our friend’s name or reach the end of list
- That what exactly Linear Search is

### Steps:

1. start at index 0
2. compare target with current element
3. if match → return index
4. if not → move to next
5. if end reached → return “not found”

### Example of linear search:

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i   # return index if found
    return -1          # -1 means not found

nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(linear_search(nums, 30))  # Output: 2
print(linear_search(nums, 100)) # Output: -1
```

### Efficiency:

- Time Complexity:
    - worst case → O(n) (need to check every element)
    - best case → O(1) (element is at first index)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (no extra storage
