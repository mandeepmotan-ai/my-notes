# Insertion Sort

- think about arranging playing cards on our hand
    - we pick one card at a time
    - place it in the correct position among the cards already sorted
    - repeat until the whole hand is sorted
- In Insertion Sort, it happens the same as we do above with cards on our hand, we pick single element from list at one time and then place it at the first, repeat until the full list gets sorted

### Steps (Ascending Order Example):

1. Start from the second element (`i = 1`), assume the first element is sorted.
2. Compare the current element with elements in the sorted part (left side).
3. Shift larger elements to the right.
4. Insert the current element into its correct position.
5. Repeat for all elements.

### **Example**

1. **Basic Insertion Sort (Ascending Order)**
    
    ```python
    def insertion_sort(arr):
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            key = arr[i]
            j = i - 1
            # shift larger elements one position to the right
            while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
            arr[j + 1] = key
        return arr
    
    nums = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
    print(insertion_sort(nums))
    # Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
    ```
    
2. **Insertion Sort (descending order)**
    
    ```python
    def insertion_sort_desc(arr):
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            key = arr[i]
            j = i - 1
            while j >= 0 and arr[j] < key:
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
                j -= 1
            arr[j + 1] = key
        return arr
    
    nums = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
    print(insertion_sort_desc(nums))
    # Output: [13, 12, 11, 6, 5]
    ```
    

## Efficiency

- **Time Complexity**:
    - Best Case (already sorted): O(n) 🎉
    - Average Case: O(n²)
    - Worst Case (reverse sorted): O(n²)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place).

**#Note:** Faster than Bubble/Selection Sort for small or partially sorted lists.
