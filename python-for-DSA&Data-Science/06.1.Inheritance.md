# Inheritance

- Inheritance allows a child class **(derived class)** to *inherit properties and methods of mother class* **(parent class)** for *reusing them*
- it allows us to follow: “Why rewrite code if we can just simply extend?”
- its kind of children inheriting traits like eye color, hair color, height, etc from there parents
- Basic Syntax for Inheritance:
    
    ```python
    class Parent:
        def show_parent(self):
            print("This is the parent class.")
    
    class Child(Parent):   # Child inherits from Parent
        def show_child(self):
            print("This is the child class.")
    
    obj = Child()
    obj.show_parent()  # inherited
    obj.show_child()   # own method
    ```
    

## Types of Inheritance in Python

1. **Single Inheritance** – one child from one parent 
2. **Multiple Inheritance** – one child inherits from multiple parents
3. **Multilevel Inheritance** – child → parent → grandparent chain
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance** – multiple children from one parent
5. **Hybrid Inheritance** – combination of above

## `super` keyword

- used to call parent methods/constructors from the child class
- its very useful when child extends from parent
- example,
    
    ```python
    class Animal:
        def __init__(self, species):
            self.species = species
        
        def sound(self):
            print("Some generic sound")
    
    class Dog(Animal):
        def __init__(self, name):
            super().__init__("Dog")   # call parent constructor
            self.name = name
        
        def sound(self):
            print("Woof Woof!")
    
    dog = Dog("Buddy")
    print(dog.species)   # Dog
    dog.sound()          # Woof Woof!
    ```
