# Encapsulation

- encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) inside a class, so that it couldn’t be directly accessed from outside class
- by this we restrict direct access to some parts of object, thus keeping the internal state of code is safe
- kind of like, **ATM machine** → we press buttons (methods), but can’t directly access cash inside (hidden attributes)

## Access Modifiers in Python

Python doesn’t enforce access modifiers strictly (like Java/C++), but uses **naming conventions**:

### 1. Public (default)

- accessible anywhere

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name   # public
s = Student("Alice")
print(s.name)   # Alice
```

### 2. Protected (_single underscore)

- should not be accessed outside class, but **still accessible**
    
    ```python
    class Student:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self._name = name   # protected
    ```
    

### 3. Private (__double underscore)

- name mangling happens → can’t access directly
    
    ```python
    class Student:
        def __init__(self, name):
            self.__name = name   # private
    s = Student("Bob")
    # print(s.__name)   ❌ Error
    print(s._Student__name)  # ✅ Bob (name mangling trick)
    ```
    

## Getters and Setter Methods

- getters and setters are special methods specifically made in class just to access and modify specific attributes from outside class
- it is considered under best practice to access/modify private variables instead of direct modifying
    
    ```python
    class BankAccount:
        def __init__(self, balance):
            self.__balance = balance   # private
    
        def get_balance(self):   # getter
            return self.__balance
    
        def deposit(self, amount):   # setter-like
            if amount > 0:
                self.__balance += amount
            else:
                print("Invalid deposit")
    
    acc = BankAccount(1000)
    print(acc.get_balance())   # 1000
    acc.deposit(500)
    print(acc.get_balance())   # 1500
    ```
