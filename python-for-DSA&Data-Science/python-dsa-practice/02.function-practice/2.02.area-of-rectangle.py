'''
Area of a Rectangle

Instructions
->Problem Description:
You are given the length and breadth of a rectangle. Your task is to compute and return the area of the rectangle.

Formula:
To calculate the area of a rectangle:
Area=lengthÃ—breadth

Input:
Two floating-point numbers, length and breadth, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
Output:
A floating-point number representing the area of the rectangle.

Example:
->Input: length = 5, breadth = 3
Output: 15.0
->Input: length = 7.5, breadth = 2.4
Output: 18.0
