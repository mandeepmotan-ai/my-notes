'''
Distance covered by a Vehicle

Instructions
->Problem Description:
You are given the speed of a vehicle and the time it has traveled. Your task is to compute and return the distance traveled by the vehicle.

Formula:
To calculate the distance traveled by a vehicle:
Distance=SpeedÃ—Time

Input:
Two floating-point numbers, speed and time, representing the speed of the vehicle and the time it has been traveling.
Output:
A floating-point number representing the distance traveled.

Example:
->Input: speed = 60, time = 2
Output: 120.0
->Input: speed = 50.5, time = 1.5
Output: 75.75
