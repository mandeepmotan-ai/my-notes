# Searching and Sorting Algorithm

## Arrays

- collection of elements stored in a continuous memory location
- all elements of arrays belong to same data type  (homogenous in nature)
- array allow for efficient access and manipulation of data
- unlike list, array is of fixed size

### Types of Arrays in Python

1. **List as Array** → `[10, 20, 30]`
2. **array module** → `array.array('i', [10,20,30])` (typed array, faster than list)
3. **NumPy array** → `np.array([10,20,30])` (powerful, used in ML/DS)
