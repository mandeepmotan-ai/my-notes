# OOPS

## OOP

- OOP = (Object Oriented Programming) a way of programming where we model things as **objects**
- **Objects** represent real-world entities (student, car, dataset, model)
- **Class** = a **blueprint** for creating objects.

## Class (Blueprint / Template)

- defines **attributes (data/properties)** and **methods (functions/behavior)**
- think of it like a **recipe** for creating objects
- eg, defining class
    
    ```python
    class Car:
        def __init__(self, brand, model):
            self.brand = brand      # attribute
            self.model = model      # attribute
        
        def drive(self):            # method
            print(f"{self.brand} {self.model} is driving...")
    ```
    

## Object (Instance of Class)

- an **object** is created from a class
- each object has its own data but follows the same structure
- eg, creating objects
    
    ```python
    car1 = Car("Tesla", "Model S")
    car2 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
    
    print(car1.brand)  # Tesla
    print(car2.brand)  # Toyota
    
    car1.drive()       # Tesla Model S is driving...
    ```
    

## `__init__()` Constructor

- a **special method** that runs automatically when creating objects
- used to **initialize attributes**
- In Java/C++ terms → Constructor
    
    ```python
    class Student:
        def __init__(self, name, age):
            self.name = name
            self.age = age
    ```
    

## Attributes vs Methods

- **Attributes** = variables inside a class → describe object properties
- **Methods** = functions inside a class → define object behavior
- example,
    
    ```python
    class Dog:
        def __init__(self, name, breed):
            self.name = name       # Attribute
            self.breed = breed
        
        def bark(self):            # Method
            print(f"{self.name} says Woof!")
    ```

## What are Magic Methods?

- Special methods in Python that start and end with **double underscores** → `__method__`.
- They **define object behavior** for built-in operations like printing, addition, comparison, iteration, etc.
- Example:
    - `__init__` → constructor (runs when object is created).
    - `__str__` → defines string representation (`print(obj)`).
    - `__add__` → defines behavior of `+` between objects.

Magic methods let you **customize how your class works with Python operators/functions**.
