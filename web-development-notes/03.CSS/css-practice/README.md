# ðŸŽ¨ CSS Practice Projects  

This folder does **not** contain the actual project files.  
Instead, it points to the **[CSS Practice directory](https://github.com/mandeepmotan-ai/mandeepmotan-ai.github.io/tree/main/web-dev)** in my portfolio repository **[`mandeepmotan-ai.github.io`](https://github.com/mandeepmotan-ai/mandeepmotan-ai.github.io)**.

## ðŸ“‚ Why this folder exists?  
My **my-notes** repo is mainly for theory, notes, and explanations.  
But CSS is all about practice ðŸŽ¯. So, instead of cluttering this notes repo, I keep my practice projects inside my portfolio repo.  

This folder serves as a **bridge** â€” giving you quick access to the practice projects while keeping my notes clean and organized.  

---

## ðŸ”— Where to find the projects?  
ðŸ‘‰ Head over to the **CSS Practice section** of my portfolio repo:  
[**View CSS Practice Projects â†’**](https://github.com/mandeepmotan-ai/mandeepmotan-ai.github.io/tree/main/web-dev)  

From there, youâ€™ll find individual project folders.  
Each folder also has a live preview hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  

Example:  
- [Project 01](https://mandeepmotan-ai.github.io/web-dev/css/01cards/card1)  
- [Project 02](https://mandeepmotan-ai.github.io/web-dev/css/01cards/card2)

âœ¨ *Notes live here. Practice lives there. Together, they cover the complete journey of learning CSS!*
